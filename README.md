Shopping_regression_DA_Batch1 

# Intro:
we made this project  as apart of training Data analysis using python  in Aiapproach club.

# Objective
Understanding Consumer Behavior: Analyzing the dataset helps businesses understand customer preferences and trends, which is essential for tailoring products and marketing strategies.
Informed Decision-Making: Insights from the data can guide businesses in making informed decisions regarding product offerings and marketing campaigns.
Enhanced Customer Experience: By understanding the preferences of different customer segments, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Predicting commodity prices: The model predicts the prices of goods according to the features that are entered to him, so he predicts the price 

# About the dataset
This data was downloaded from the Kaggle website, and it is data generated by artificial intelligence for educational purposes in data analysis and machine learning, and the name of this data is shopping_trends.
The data contains the number of three thousand nine hundred rows and nineteen columns The columns represent the features and rows The number of customers. 
The columns display information about customers in each row, such as the type of purchase, the method of payment, the purchasing season.

# Steps :
First, we downloaded the database from the Kaggle website
Second, review and read the data
Third, displaying details about the data such as the number of columns and rows and what are the columns and review of the information inside the fields 
Fourth, start the analysis by cleaning the data from empty or duplicate data and then add some columns to the database to help understand the data, such as dividing the age into age groups (Teens, Youth, Adults, Older) 
Fifth, presenting the data with illustrations that facilitate linking the data and making decisions based on these drawings.
Sixth, We determine the features that we will introduce to the model to be trained on it, as well as determine the date that the model will expect, and here is the price of the products.
Seventh, we divide the data into data for training and testing. Eighth, we call some prediction algorithms to choose the most appropriate ones to use and we have tried the Linear Regression &eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm.
Eighth, we used Hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.
Ninth, we saved the moodle. 
Tenth, we tried the moodle.
Finally, we built a Flask file to use in trying the model in the Postman application; We tried the model in the Postman application

 # Project Conclusion:
 This project illustrates dataset analysis of shopping trends to make decisions such as:
 1. Marketing strategies: Companies can design targeted marketing campaigns based on age groups, purchase history, and preferred payment methods.
 2. Product development: Insights into customer preferences can inform product development and inventory management, ensuring that offerings align with customer needs.
 3. Track performance: Companies can track changes in consumer behavior over time, allowing adjustments in strategy to be made as needed.
 4. The model predicts the price of the products, which contributes to the study of prices and their proportion with the behavior of customers and their purchases.
